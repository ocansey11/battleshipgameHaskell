# Battleship Game - Haskell Implementation

## Project Status ✅
- **Command-line version**: WORKING ✅
- **Web version**: BLOCKED (Windows compatibility issues) ❌
- **Core game logic**: COMPLETE ✅

## What We Built Today

### ✅ Working Command-Line Game
A fully functional Battleship game in Haskell with:
- Random ship placement
- Turn-based gameplay (Human vs Computer)
- Enhanced visual display with ASCII borders
- Input validation (supports both "A3" and "0,3" formats)
- Win/loss detection
- Clean functional programming design

**To play**: Run `run.bat` and choose option 1

### ✅ Core Haskell Modules
- `Ship.hs` - Ship data types and operations
- `Board.hs` - Game board logic and ship placement
- `Player.hs` - Player types and computer AI
- `Game.hs` - Game state management
- `Utils.hs` - Display and input utilities
- `Main.hs` - Game loop and UI

### ❌ Web Interface Issues
Multiple attempts failed due to Windows dependencies:
1. **WAI/Warp** - Required `old-time` package with Unix configure scripts
2. **Snap/Heist** - Network package compilation issues
3. **Simple HTTP servers** - Same dependency conflicts

## Major Recurring Issues We Hit

### 1. Windows Package Compatibility ⚠️
**Problem**: Many Haskell web packages require Unix tools
- `old-time` needs `./configure` script 
- `network` package fails on Windows
- `time` package configure issues

**Solutions to Try Tomorrow**:
- Use `servant` framework (more Windows-friendly)
- Try `scotty` web framework (lighter dependencies)
- Use `http-simple` instead of lower-level packages
- Consider WSL2 for better Linux compatibility

### 2. Unicode Terminal Issues 🖥️
**Problem**: Windows terminal doesn't handle Unicode well
- ANSI color codes failed
- Unicode symbols caused crashes

**Solution Applied**: Disabled colors, used ASCII characters

### 3. Missing Exports 📦
**Problem**: Functions not exported from modules
**Solution Applied**: Added exports to module headers

## Simple Plan for Tomorrow 📋

### Option A: Servant Web Framework
```haskell
-- Much cleaner, Windows-friendly
dependencies: servant, servant-server, warp
-- Known to work better on Windows
```

### Option B: JavaScript Bridge
```html
<!-- Static HTML + localStorage -->
<!-- Simulate game without server -->
<!-- Focus on learning Haskell logic -->
```

### Option C: Desktop GUI
```haskell
-- Use `brick` for terminal UI
-- Or `gtk` for native Windows GUI
-- Avoid web entirely
```

## Key Lessons Learned 🎓
1. **Haskell core logic is excellent** - Clean, type-safe, functional
2. **Windows web development is tricky** - Dependency hell
3. **Command-line version works great** - Focus on this first
4. **Incremental approach works** - Build working pieces first

## Next Session Goals 🎯
1. **Fix web version** with simpler framework
2. **Enhance command-line UI** with better graphics
3. **Add more game features** (ship placement, difficulty levels)
4. **Document the Haskell learning journey**

*The Haskell game logic is solid and much better than the original JavaScript version!* 
*The functional programming approach makes the code more reliable and easier to reason about.*
